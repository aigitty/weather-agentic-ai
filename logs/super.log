There's no precipitation expected in the next few hours. The cloud cover is moderate, with a mix of clouds and clear skies.

As for the past weather, I've analyzed the data from the past few days, and everything seems to be within normal limits. However, I did notice that there was a slight increase in precipitation on October 28th, but it was just a light drizzle.

Looking ahead to the forecast, it seems like the weather will remain mostly dry and clear for the next few days, with temperatures gradually increasing. However, I did notice that there's a slight chance of precipitation on October 29th, but it's still uncertain at this point.

Overall, it's a pleasant evening in Kochi, and I don't expect any severe weather conditions in the next few days.
